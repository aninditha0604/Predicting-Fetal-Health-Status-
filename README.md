#Predicting Fetal Health Status with K-Nearest Neighbors

## Why this is important 

- United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and is a key indicator of human progress. They expect that by 2030, countries will strive to stop the deaths of newborns that are preventable.
- The U.S. fetal mortality rate was 5.73 fetal deaths at 20 weeks of gestation(development inside the womb between conception and birth) or more per 1,000 live births (as of 2021)
- Fetal Mortality is linked to maternal mortality.  Globally, every two minutes, a woman dies during pregnancy or childbirth. In 2020, there were an estimated 287,000 deaths worldwide. 
- Fetal Mortality is also linked to neonatal mortality, which accounts for approximately 2.3 million deaths in the first month of life globally(around 6,400 deaths every day) as of 2021.
- A vast majority of these deaths occurred in low-resource settings, and most could have been prevented. Based on data from 2017, around 94% of the deaths were preventable.
- This dataset has been obtained from the analysis of a cost-accessible and safe method called “Cardiotocograms”. Cardiotocography (CTGs) comprises fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) and is continuously recorded noninvasively during labor. 
- CTG uses ultrasound sound waves to detect the baby's heart rate and gives back information about the baby's heart rate, the baby's movements, and the mother’s contractions
